## A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app


# Target Audience

## Who is your target audience? Be specific.
Corporate event planners


## What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
Make it simple.


## Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
no


# Research

## Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

## This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
It should take us about 4 days to deliver a finished application.
